  <h2>About This Website</h2>
  <p>This is the blog to record and share what I thought/saw/learned and anything happened in my life.</p>
<p>You might be curious about why this blog uses "backtrace.top" as its domain. When I wrapped my head around choosing a domain, I looked around to see if there's anything that can give me some insights, and right at that moment I saw the program got stopped at a breakpoint in Xcode, with the backtrace shown in the left panel. It inspired me that the backtrace is just like a list of posts. The latest function call locates on the top, as the newest post would be shown on the top of list in my blog.</p>
<p>Hopefully the domain would be permanent so that I don't need to change the above definition.</p>
